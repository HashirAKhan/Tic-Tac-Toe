# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game created using python. It can be played against a simple AI or against another player

The AI will first look through the board to search for a play that would result in itself winning.
If not it will look to see if there is a spot that needs to be blocked to prevent its human opponent from winning
and if none of these are true then it will mark a random spot.

currently it is set to only make a "smart" play 80% of the time to prevent too many ties.
